# Introducing the team

DM2L is a team created in 2012 whose scientific activity is devoted to Knowledge Discovery from Data using automatic or semi-automatic techniques. This includes: data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, statistical learning, data analysis, natural language processing, data archeology, etc. Its research interests are mainly data mining and machine learning.

# Fields of interest

DM2L team leverages about ten permanent researchers whose computer skills and research interests are complementary. More specifically, the team is working on the following problems:
* Fundamentals of constrain-based mining
* N-ary relations or Boolean tensors mining
* Spatio-temporal data mining
* Dynamic attributed graph mining
* Ensemble learning
* Learning probabilistic graphical models
* Unsupervised learning with and without constraints
* Natural language processing and geographic information retrieval

Our results are theoretical, methodological, algorithmic, software, and applications. Our guiding principle is to try to help data owners throughout the interactive process of knowledge discovery from data. As these processes require the combination of a wide range of paradigms of description or induction (pattern extraction, classification, statistical learning, including Bayesian networks, set-methods, kernel methods, connectionist methods, etc.), 

# Applications
Our research is developed in relation to real data analysis: the quantitative and qualitative empirical study on real data is absolutely essential. While DM2L research team develops mainly methods and algorithms rather than applications, it works with owners of data from several environments. If the life sciences and molecular biology have been particularly targeted in recent years, we are also interested in the study of data related to "Intelligences Urban Worlds" labex (eco-technologies and "urban monitoring", transport and mobility, the emergence communities and analysis of social interactions, understanding of the human impact on the environment and biodiversity, etc.) while pursuing applications in areas such as health, design and monitoring of manufactured goods and digital humanities. This diversity shows our willingness to be centered "Methods" and develop generic algorithms applicable to a broad spectrum of applications.

# Contributions
In addition to many major annual conferences that are common to DM and ML, machine learning specific conferences are mainly [ICML](https://icml.cc), [UAI](https://www.auai.org), and [NIPS](https://nips.cc). Similarly, in addition to the major journals on KDD, there are few well established journals that are dedicated to learning methods ([Journal of Machine Learning Research](https://www.jmlr.org), [Pattern Recognition](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/pattern-recognition), [Machine Learning](https://www.springer.com/journal/10994), [Neurocomputing](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/neurocomputing)). Significant contributions in data mining and machine learning can occur in conferences (and journals) of Artificial Intelligence (eg, [IJCAI](https://www.ijcai.org), [AAAI](https://aaai.org/), ECAI, Artificial Intelligence), data management (eg, [VLDB](https://www.vldb.org/conference.html), [ACM CIKM](http://www.cikmconference.org), Information Systems) and Geographic Information Science (eg, [IJGIS](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tgis20/current), [ACM SIGSPATIAL](https://www.sigspatial.org))
