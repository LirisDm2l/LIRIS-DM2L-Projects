# Introducing the team

DM2L (Data Mining & Machine Learning) is a scientific team created in 2012 whose research activity is devoted to Knowledge Discovery from Data based on automatic or semi-automatic techniques. This includes data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, data analysis, natural language processing, etc. 

# Fields of interest

DM2L team leverages about 7 permanent researchers whose computer skills and research interests are complementary. More specifically, the team is working on the following problems:
•	Fundamentals of constraint-based mining
•	N-ary relations or Boolean tensors mining
•	Spatio-temporal data mining
•	Dynamic, attributed graph analysis and mining
•	Ensemble learning
•	Learning probabilistic graphical models
•	Natural language processing and geographic information retrieval
•	Semi-supervised learning
•	Representation learning
•	Multi-label learning
•	Multi-view learning
•	Dimensionality learning
•	Deep Learning
•	XAI

Our results are theoretical, methodological, algorithmic and practical. Our guiding principle is to try to help data owners throughout the interactive process of knowledge discovery from data. As these processes require the combination of a wide range of paradigms of description or induction (pattern extraction, classification, regression, clustering, outlier detection, data reduction, domain adaptation, etc.)

# Applications
Our research is developed in close relation to real world applications: the quantitative and qualitative empirical study on real data is essential. While DM2L research team develops mainly methods and algorithms rather than applications, it works with owners of data from several environments. Our application domains contain, but not only:
-	Health,
-	Predictive maintenance,
-	Biology,
-	Finance and Cryptocurrencies,
-	Competitive intelligence,
-	Urban monitoring, 
-	Digital humanity
-	Neuroscience,
-	Cognitive services, 
-	CRM,
-	Transport and mobility 

# Contributions
In addition to many major annual conferences that are common to DM and ML, machine learning-specific conferences are mainly ICML, Neurips, ECML/PKDD. Similarly, in addition to the major journals on KDD, there are few well established journals that are dedicated to learning methods (IEEE TNNLS, Journal of Machine Learning Research, Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, Neurocomputing,). Significant contributions in data mining and machine learning can occur in conferences (and journals) of Artificial Intelligence (eg, IJCAI, AAAI, ECAI, Artificial Intelligence), data management (eg, VLDB, ACM CIKM, Information Systems, IEEE TKDE, KAIS), Network Science (e.g., CN & Applications, Journal of Complex Networks), and Geographic Information Science (eg, IJGIS, ACM SIGSPATIAL).
