# Subgroup Discovery / Exceptional Model Mining

* __RefineAndMine__ is an algorithm for discovering subgroups in numerical data. It has three key properties w.r.t. the state of the art: (i) It yields progressively interval patterns whose quality improves over time; (ii) It can be interrupted anytime and always gives a guarantee bounding the error on the top pattern quality and (iii) It always bounds a distance to the exhaustive exploration.

* __MCTS4DM__: Pattern mining & Subgroup Discovery with Monte Carlo Tree Search. By formally defining pattern mining as a game, we can  solve it with Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). It can be seen as an exhaustive search guided by random simulations which can be stopped early (limited budget) by virtue of its best-first search property. MCTS4DM allows one to mine subgroups in symbolic/numerical data (considering all possible intervals without discretization) with various quality measure (such as the weighted relative accuracy) and can be easily extended to other measures.

* __DSC__: Exceptional Model Mining in vote or rating data. This algorithm makes it possible to discover exceptional (dis)agreements between two groups of individuals. The discovered patterns are of the form (c,g1,g2) where __c__ is the context in which an exceptional (dis)agreement is observed between the two groups of individuals __g1__ and __g2__.

# Pattern mining algorithms for attributed graphs

* __ENERGETICS__ and __EXPRESS__ are two algorithms that allow to discover exceptional patterns in __vertex attributed graphs__. ENERGETICS is an exhaustive algorithm while EXPRESS is an output space sampling algorithm. These algorithms were presented at IEEE ICDM 2016. For more details:

* __CENERGETICS__ and __EXCESS__   are built respectively on top  ENERGETICS and EXPRESS by considering closed patterns. For more details:

# Pattern mining algorithms for sequences 
* __BalanceSpan__ is an algorithm designed to extract frequent patterns (strategies) from StarCraft II replays. It efficiently computes a measure that evaluates the __balance of a strategy__, i.e., if the strategy is likely to win or to lose. It allows the user (i) studying his opponent in an E-sport match, (ii) learning from his own games, and (iii), for the game editor, to study if the rules of the game needs to be adapted due to imbalanced strategies used too often.

* __SITS-P2miner__ is a mining system for extracting patterns from Satellite Image Time Series. It includes four main modules for pre-processing, pattern extraction, pattern ranking and pattern visualization. It is based on the extraction of grouped frequent sequential patterns and on swap randomization.

# Other pattern domains
* __MCPP__: Mining Convex Polygon Patterns in Spatial Datasets. Pattern mining considers the search space of numerical data as a set of hyperectangles with sides parallel to the cordinates. We present here several algorithms to mine more expresive numerical patterns: convex polygons.

# Data generators
* EPCIS is a GS1 standard to encode products as they travel throughout the supply chain. As this kind of data is generally sensitive, and because random generators can not easily capture real behaviors, we propose to capture data from the famous game OpenTTD version 1.5.0. This plugin captures all the transportation and the manufacturing events that happen in the game (made by real players of the myriad of available artificial agents) and writes them into an output file using the EPCIS format.
